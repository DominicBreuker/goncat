# NOTE: SOCKS ASSOCIATE (UDP tunneling) test
# Unfortunately, socat does not support SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE command directly.
# This would require implementing a custom SOCKS5 client that:
# 1. Sends ASSOCIATE command to proxy
# 2. Receives UDP relay address
# 3. Sends UDP datagrams to relay address with SOCKS5 UDP header
# 4. Receives UDP datagrams back from relay
#
# For now, we'll verify that the SOCKS proxy starts up correctly with -D flag
# and that the TCP connection works. Full UDP ASSOCIATE testing would require
# a dedicated SOCKS5 UDP client implementation.

# Start goncat master with SOCKS proxy
# -D 127.0.0.1:1080 enables SOCKS5 proxy including UDP ASSOCIATE support

# For now, we just verify the SOCKS proxy is running

# - Connect to SOCKS proxy on TCP
# - Send SOCKS5 ASSOCIATE command
# - Receive UDP relay endpoint
# - Send UDP packet with SOCKS5 header to relay endpoint
# - Receive UDP response from slave-companion
