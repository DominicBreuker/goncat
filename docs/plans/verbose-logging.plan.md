# Plan for Verbose Logging Enhancement

Enhance the existing `--verbose` flag implementation to provide comprehensive debug logging throughout the goncat tool for troubleshooting connection issues, port forwarding, SOCKS proxy operations, and lifecycle events.

## Overview

The current `--verbose` flag is minimally implemented - it only toggles certain error messages in a few places (terminal.go, exec files). This plan expands verbose logging to provide developers and operators with detailed visibility into:

- Connection establishment and teardown (TCP, WebSocket, UDP/QUIC)
- TLS handshake operations (both transport-level and application-level)
- Master-slave session setup and control message exchanges
- Port forwarding: listener startup, connection forwarding, session cleanup (TCP and UDP)
- SOCKS proxy: listener startup, client connections, protocol negotiation, connection forwarding
- Context cancellations, deadline expirations, and error conditions throughout the stack

The implementation will:
1. Avoid package-level state by passing a logger through the config
2. Add a `log.VerboseMsg(format, ...interface{})` function that only logs when verbose mode is enabled
3. Strategically place verbose logging at key points in the codebase
4. Keep logs focused on lifecycle events and error conditions, not excessive internal details

## Implementation plan

- [V] Step 1: Refactor log package to support stateful logger
  - **Task**: Modify `pkg/log/log.go` to support a logger struct that can be initialized with verbose settings and passed through the config. The logger should avoid package-level state while maintaining backward compatibility with existing `ErrorMsg()` and `InfoMsg()` calls.
  - **Completed**: Added Logger struct with verbose field, NewLogger constructor, VerboseMsg method (nil-safe, no-op when verbose=false), and ErrorMsg/InfoMsg methods on Logger. Maintained backward compatibility with package-level ErrorMsg/InfoMsg functions via defaultLogger. Added comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality. All tests pass.
  - **Files**:
    - `pkg/log/log.go`: Added Logger struct with verbose field. Added constructor `NewLogger(verbose bool) *Logger`. Added method `func (l *Logger) VerboseMsg(format string, a ...interface{})` that only prints when `l.verbose` is true. Added package-level default logger for backward compatibility.
      ```go
      // Logger provides structured logging with verbose mode support
      type Logger struct {
          verbose bool
      }
      
      // NewLogger creates a new logger with the given verbose setting
      func NewLogger(verbose bool) *Logger {
          return &Logger{verbose: verbose}
      }
      
      // VerboseMsg logs a message only if verbose mode is enabled
      func (l *Logger) VerboseMsg(format string, a ...interface{}) {
          if l == nil || !l.verbose {
              return
          }
          if !strings.HasSuffix(format, "\n") {
              format = format + "\n"
          }
          // Use a distinct color/prefix for verbose messages, e.g., gray or yellow
          fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "[v] "+format, a...)
      }
      
      // Keep existing package-level functions for backward compatibility
      var defaultLogger = NewLogger(false)
      
      func ErrorMsg(format string, a ...interface{}) {
          defaultLogger.ErrorMsg(format, a...)
      }
      
      func InfoMsg(format string, a ...interface{}) {
          defaultLogger.InfoMsg(format, a...)
      }
      ```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Stateful Logger in Config**: The logger is instantiated once during CLI command parsing and passed through `config.Shared`. This avoids package-level state while maintaining simplicity. The logger is accessible wherever `config.Shared` is available.

2. **VerboseMsg Implementation**: The `VerboseMsg` method is a no-op when verbose mode is disabled, making it safe to call everywhere without performance impact.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `ErrorMsg()` and `InfoMsg()` package-level functions remain unchanged, ensuring no breaking changes for existing code.

4. **Log Format**: Verbose messages use a distinct prefix `[v]` to differentiate from error `[!]` and info `[+]` messages. This makes it easy to filter or parse verbose output.

5. **Strategic Placement**: Verbose logging focuses on:
   - Connection lifecycle events (start, success, failure, close)
   - Protocol negotiations and handshakes
   - Resource allocation and cleanup
   - Control message flow in master-slave communication
   - Error conditions and cancellations
   
   It avoids logging:
   - Every byte of data transferred
   - Internal function entry/exit (except at key boundaries)
   - Redundant or noisy details

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Validate Logger.VerboseMsg behavior (logs when verbose=true, silent when false)
- **Integration tests**: Update to set Logger in mock configs, add at least one test validating verbose output
- **Manual verification**: Three mandatory scenarios (basic shell, port forwarding, SOCKS proxy) to ensure verbose logging is helpful in real usage
- **E2E tests**: Run existing E2E tests to ensure verbose logging doesn't break functionality (E2E tests don't use --verbose flag)

### Performance Considerations

- `VerboseMsg()` early-exits when verbose=false, so overhead is minimal (just a boolean check)
- No string formatting occurs when verbose mode is disabled
- Logger is passed by pointer through config, so no excessive copying

### Potential Issues & Mitigations

1. **Issue**: Nil pointer dereference if Logger is not initialized
   - **Mitigation**: VerboseMsg checks `if l == nil` and returns early. Integration tests explicitly set Logger in config.

2. **Issue**: Too much log output cluttering the terminal
   - **Mitigation**: Verbose logging is opt-in via --verbose flag. Users enable it only when troubleshooting.

3. **Issue**: Tests break due to Logger expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Integration tests set Logger=log.NewLogger(false) to maintain current behavior. Unit tests that need verbose logging can enable it selectively.

4. **Issue**: Race conditions when multiple goroutines log
   - **Mitigation**: Logger uses fmt.Fprintf which is thread-safe. No shared mutable state in Logger struct.

### Code Review Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All VerboseMsg calls include helpful context (addresses, IDs, operation names)
- [ ] Verbose logging doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Integration tests pass with Logger initialized
- [ ] Manual verification scenarios all pass
- [ ] No package-level state introduced
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (ErrorMsg/InfoMsg still work)
- [ ] Documentation updated with examples

## Security Considerations

Verbose logging may expose additional information to stderr such as:
- IP addresses and ports
- Session IDs
- Protocol details
- Timing information

This is acceptable since:
- Verbose mode is opt-in (not enabled by default)
- Output goes to stderr (not logged to files unless explicitly redirected)
- The intended audience is developers/operators who need this info for troubleshooting
- No sensitive data like keys/passwords are logged

## Summary

This plan enhances the existing `--verbose` flag to provide comprehensive debug logging throughout goncat. By refactoring the log package to support a stateful logger passed through config.Shared, we avoid package-level state while providing flexible, opt-in verbose logging. The implementation focuses on connection lifecycle, protocol negotiations, and resource management - exactly what developers need to troubleshoot issues in production or development.

The implementation follows these principles:
- **Minimal state**: Logger in config, no package-level mutable state
- **Backward compatible**: Existing log functions unchanged
- **Opt-in**: Verbose logging only when --verbose flag is used
- **Helpful**: Logs provide context and aid troubleshooting
- **Testable**: Logger can be mocked or stubbed in tests
- **Safe**: No race conditions, no nil pointer dereferences
