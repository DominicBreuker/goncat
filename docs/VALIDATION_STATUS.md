# Validation Scripts Status Report

**Last Updated:** Session ending with 887,000 tokens remaining
**Overall Status:** 15/15 scripts passing (100%) ✅

## All Scripts Passing (15/15 - 100%) ✅

### Transport Scripts (4/4 - 100%)
- ✅ **01-transport-tcp.sh** - TCP transport with token validation, listener persistence
- ✅ **02-transport-ws.sh** - WebSocket transport with data verification
- ✅ **03-transport-wss.sh** - WebSocket Secure with TLS
- ✅ **04-transport-udp.sh** - UDP/QUIC with multi-line payload testing

### Security Scripts (2/2 - 100%)
- ✅ **05-encryption-ssl.sh** - 6 test cases: SSL success/mismatch, mTLS success/failure, errors
- ✅ **06-authentication-key.sh** - 3 test cases: mTLS success, wrong key, key-without-SSL error

### Execution Scripts (2/2 - 100%)
- ✅ **07-exec-simple.sh** - Command execution with token validation
- ✅ **08-exec-pty.py** - PTY mode with pexpect: TTY, Ctrl+C, line editing, exit

### Feature Scripts (3/3 - 100%)
- ✅ **09-portfwd-local-tcp.sh** - Local TCP port forwarding with HTTP tunnel validation
- ✅ **19-behavior-graceful-shutdown.sh** - SIGINT propagation and detection
- ✅ **20-feature-logging.sh** - Session log file creation and validation

### SOCKS Proxy (1/1 - 100%) ✅
- ✅ **14-socks-tcp-connect.sh** - SOCKS5 TCP CONNECT proxy validation
  - **Solution:** Uses FIFO for stdin control to keep session alive
  - **Implementation:** Creates named pipe, sends "sleep 30" to keep shell running
  - **Testing:** Python SOCKS client for reliable connection testing
  - **Verification:** Verifies data transfer and proxy persistence

### Connection Behaviors (4/4 - 100%)
- ✅ **16-behavior-connect-close.sh** - Connect-mode exit, listen-mode persistence
- ✅ **17-behavior-timeout.sh** - Timeout detection when connection dies
- ✅ **18-behavior-stability.sh** - Connection works with short timeout (100ms)
- ✅ **19-behavior-graceful-shutdown.sh** - SIGINT propagation and detection

## Technical Breakthrough

### SOCKS Proxy Solution
The SOCKS proxy test was the most challenging to automate. The key insights:

1. **SOCKS requires active session**: The proxy only exists while master/slave session is alive
2. **Session needs work to stay alive**: Without `--exec`, session closes immediately
3. **Shell needs commands**: With `--exec /bin/sh`, need to send commands to keep shell running
4. **FIFO provides control**: Named pipe allows controlled stdin for background processes

**Final Solution:**
```bash
# Create FIFO for stdin control
mkfifo "$FIFO"
exec 3>"$FIFO"

# Start master reading from FIFO
goncat master listen ... --exec /bin/sh < "$FIFO" &

# Keep session alive
echo "sleep 30" >&3

# Test SOCKS proxy
python3 -c "... SOCKS5 client code ..."
```

This approach:
- Keeps stdin open via FIFO
- Allows commands to be sent to slave's shell
- Prevents session from closing prematurely
- Enables reliable SOCKS proxy testing

### Connection Behavior Scripts
Scripts 16-18 were fixed using similar approaches:
- Send commands via FIFO when needed
- Use sleep to keep connections alive
- Verify log messages for behavior validation
- Test actual network behavior, not just CLI flags

## Quality Assessment

### Excellent (Production Ready - All Scripts)
- ✅ All transport scripts (01-04): Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ All security scripts (05-06): Full test matrices (9 test cases)
- ✅ All execution scripts (07-08): Including excellent PTY testing  
- ✅ Port forwarding (09): HTTP tunnel validation
- ✅ SOCKS proxy (14): Python SOCKS client validation
- ✅ All connection behaviors (16-19): Lifecycle, timeout, stability, shutdown
- ✅ Session logging (20): File creation and validation

### Summary
**100% of scripts are production ready and passing reliably.**
