# Test local port forwarding (-L) functionality  
# This test demonstrates that local port forwarding works by:
# 1. Starting goncat master connect with -L flag to forward local port 9999 to slave's localhost:8888
# 2. Starting an HTTP server on slave side that only listens on localhost:8888 
# 3. Verifying that the port forwarding tunnel can carry HTTP traffic
# 4. Making multiple HTTP requests to prove the connection is stable
